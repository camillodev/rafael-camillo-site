# About

Hello! I am Rafael Camillo, a Senior Software Engineer with over 7 years of experience, specializing in Front End with proficiency in **Angular, React, Vue.js, Node.js, MongoDB, SQL Server, and .Net C#**, and an aspiring Product Manager. Currently, I am based in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, and have been working remotely for international companies, mainly in the United States.

## Professional Experience

My journey has been a mix of coding, strategic planning, and fostering collaborative environments. I have a proven track record of leading projects that resonate with users and drive business growth.

Here are some of the feedbacks I received from colleagues and clients on LinkedIn:

"Rafael is an excellent communicator, team player, and community person. His strong knowledge in Vue.js, React, Node.js, and GraphQL enabled us to build a performant and scalable application." - Marcos Leonel, Senior Software Engineer.

"Rafael helped us with fixing bugs and building new features in VueJS for our data science education platform. He cheerfully tackled anything we needed to work on, and was very easy to collaborate with." - Elliot Murphy.

"Rafael is an incredible professional... He always brought important questions to meetings and planning, and his communication was crystal clear. He cares a lot about code and product quality..." - Armando Ferraz Gra√ßa Neto, Java Tech Lead.

I am open to new opportunities and collaborations. If you are interested in discussing a project or just want to chat about technology, I would be happy to
