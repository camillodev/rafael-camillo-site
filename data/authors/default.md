Hello! I’m Rafael Camillo, a seasoned Senior Software Engineer and an aspiring Product Manager with a track record of spearheading projects that resonate with users and drive business growth. With over seven years of immersive experience across diverse industries, my journey has been a blend of coding, strategic planning, and fostering collaborative environments.

Rooted in the vibrant city of Belo Horizonte, Brazil, my professional path has meandered through various international realms, notably in the United States. The essence of remote collaboration and cross-cultural communication has been the hallmark of my career, nurturing not only my technical acumen but also my knack for managing distributed teams and projects.

My technical canvas is colored with proficiency in Angular, React, Vue.js, Node.js, MongoDB, SQL Server, and .Net C#. Agile methodologies are my go-to companions for orchestrating projects with a rhythm that ensures timely delivery, quality, and a dose of fun. Transitioning towards Product Management, I’ve embraced the realm of user research, product design, and customer development, aligning technical solutions with user-centric approaches to deliver products that hit the sweet spot of user satisfaction and business objectives.

I am a staunch advocate for remote work, thriving in setups where cross-functional teams collaborate to churn out amazing digital products. My blog is a glimpse into my thoughts on software engineering, product management insights, and the dynamics of remote teamwork.

When the code settles, and the product roadmaps are drawn, you’ll find me mingling in local tech meetups, enjoying a cup of Brazil's finest coffee, or amidst nature on a hiking trail.

I am driven by the infinite potential of technology to craft experiences that matter and am on a perpetual quest to hone my skills, broaden my understanding, and contribute meaningfully to the digital sphere. Whether it’s a challenging project, a discussion on product strategies, or a casual tech chatter, I’m just a message away!
