[Previously](https://rafaelcamillo.com/pt-br/blog/react-management-state) we briefly covered state management options in React. Today it's Redux.

# What is Redux?

Redux is a popular state management library for JavaScript applications, especially used in conjunction with React, but not limited to it. It was created by Dan Abramov and Andrew Clark. The main goal of Redux is to provide a predictable way of managing application state, making it easier to track changes and maintain code.

# Fundamental Principles of Redux:

- **Single Source of Truth**: The state of the entire application is stored in a single store object. This facilitates state management and debugging.

- **State is Read Only**: The state cannot be changed directly. State changes are made through pure actions, called "actions", which are objects describing what has happened.

- Changes Made with Pure Functions\*\*: To specify how the state is transformed by actions, you use pure functions called "reducers". A reducer is a function that takes the current state and an action as arguments, and returns a new state.

# User Session Management with Redux:

A practical example of the use of Redux is in the management of user sessions in web applications. Actions can include login, logout and updating user data. The reducers correspond to these actions to update the state of the session in the store.

- Actions: These are JavaScript objects that contain information about an action that should take place. They are the only means of sending data to the store.

```jsx
const loginSuccess = (user) => ({ type: 'LOGIN_SUCCESS', payload: user })
const logout = () => ({ type: 'LOGOUT' })
```

- Reducers: These are pure functions that take the previous state and an action, and return the new state. They describe how the state is updated in response to actions sent to the store.

```jsx
const sessionReducer = (state = { user: null, isAuthenticated: false }, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'LOGIN_SUCCESS':
      return { ...state, isAuthenticated: true, user: action.payload }
    case 'LOGOUT':
      return { ...state, isAuthenticated: false, user: null }
    default:
      return state
  }
}
```

- **Store**: This is the object where the application's state is stored. The store has methods to allow access to the state, dispatch actions and register listeners.

```jsx
import { createStore } from 'redux'
import sessionReducer from './sessionReducer'

const store = createStore(sessionReducer)

export default store
```

# Use with React:

In the context of React, Redux makes it easier to manage state that is shared by many components, especially in large and complex applications. It allows state to be kept outside the components, making them lighter and focused only on the user interface. This also improves the testability and scalability of the application.

# Why Use Redux?

- State Predictability\*\*: With strict rules about how and when updates can happen, it's easier to understand the flow of data and the logic of the application.

- Maintenance and Scalability\*\*: Redux offers a structure that helps organize the code and makes it easier to scale the application.

- Developer Tools\*\*: Includes powerful tools, such as Redux DevTools, to track, record and inspect all states and actions.

- Community and Ecosystem\*\*: Redux has a large community, which means many features, middleware and extensions available.

Although Redux is a powerful tool, it is not necessary for all React applications. It is most useful in applications with complex state logic and where many states are shared between different components.
