# The Challenging Landscape

Picture an environment where the term "Product Manager" is virtually taboo. A place where stakeholders are perpetually frustrated and the engineering team is on the brink of burnout. It was in this turbulent setting that I found myself leading a product for a particularly challenging client.

# The Heart of the Issues

## Disgruntled Stakeholders

Complaints ranged from "We're completely in the dark!" to "Our urgent demands seem to go into a black hole!" The lack of visibility and delays in deliveries created a vicious cycle of distrust.

## Overwhelmed Engineering Team

Here, the challenges were multiple: accumulated technical debt, frequent changes in requirements, and a workload overload that made it nearly impossible to stick to deadlines.

# The Transformation Strategy

## Rotational Product Leadership

My first course of action was to implement a rotational product leadership. This not only distributed the workload but also provided unique insight into the challenges faced by all involved.

## Deep Dive Diagnosis

During my stint in the rotation, I had one-on-one conversations with stakeholders and team members to perform a deep diagnosis of the issues.

# The Action Plan

## 1. Clear and Transparent Communication

I established weekly update meetings. But it was not merely a matter of reporting status; I trained the team to translate technical challenges into language that stakeholders could understand.

## 2. Focus on Resolving Technical Debts

I allocated our senior developer to deal exclusively with technical debts. This included the challenging upgrade from an older version of Vue.js to the latest one.

## 3. Structuring Epics

I divided the project into clearly defined epics with specific dates and requirements. This served to set realistic expectations for all involved.

## 4. Quick Response Channel

I developed a workflow for urgent demands. This meant sometimes providing provisional solutions, like reports pulled straight from the database, to meet immediate needs.

# The Outcome

The transformation was remarkable. The team became more focused, and stakeholders gained a level of visibility that was previously non-existent. The project, which had been navigating troubled waters, found its course.
